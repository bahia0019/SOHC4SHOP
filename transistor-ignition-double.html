				This <b>Electronic Ignition</b> for your motorcycle (and for old cars or
				boats, contact me for those details) uses your existing points to
				trigger transistors that switch the coils in the bike's ignition: in
				effect, it is like a "points amplifier". This stops all the arcing and
				pitting on the points, so they do not shift in timing nor wear their
				contacts, giving you many years of trouble-free riding. And, should this
				device ever fail, it can be simply unplugged and your points plugged
				back in, so you can ride on. They are highly reliable units, and have
				been around since the 1970s: this unit comes with a 5 year, 100%
				replacement-or-repair warranty.<br /><br />

				Both 4-cylinder and dual-point 2-cylinder bikes use the same unit.
				Literature accompanies each unit to aid with installation, which is a
				simple, plug-in assembly on SOHC4 bike and Honda Twins. Installation is
				similar on the Kawasaki, Suzuki, and Yamaha dual-point Fours and Twins.
				<br /><br />

				Installation takes about 1 hour and consists of mounting the box first,
				usually under or behind the battery tray, with a couple of nylon
				Ty-Wraps. The wires are then routed to the coils and the points
				connections, and this unit is specifically designed to PLUG IN on the
				Honda, Kawasaki, and Suzuki Fours and Twins, except for the Green Ground
				wire, which must mount to the points plate itself. Extra connectors are
				provided in case the bike's aging bullet connectors are worn or
				corroded. Timing and points setup remains exactly the same as your stock
				settings.<br /><br />

				Benefits of using this device include easier starting and less
				cold-bloodedness at startup, stronger spark through the entire RPM
				range, cleaner spark plugs, and extremely reduced points wear. In most
				situations, there is no need to replace your points when installing this
				unit, so long as the engine already runs.<br /><br />

				<b>The primary advantages of this system:</b><br /><br />
				1. The original dwell is preserved (no other electronic replacement
				system provides this feature).<br /><br />
				2. The power consumption is only 0.1 amp more than stock, max. In
				comparison: the typical Dyna S uses a little over 1 amp extra current,
				as do other similar "electronic trigger" systems.<br /><br />
				3. Points and condensors stay in place: this provides 100% backup if the
				electronics should ever fail. You can unplug the 4 wires to the points
				and coils, plug the points back into the coils, and hit the road again
				in (literally) about 2 minutes, even on a hot bike.<br /><br />
				4. This unit has a 5-year, 100% warranty: if it fails, I'll fix it for
				return postage only.<br /><br />

				Shipping is $9.00 inside the U.S. and $21.00 to Canada via Priority
				Mail. Shipping to UK is typically around $18 in a padded envelope, but
				Customs Security will usually delay the delivery until you contact your
				post office (it has wires, after all...). <br /><br />

				Delivery: stock to 2 weeks. If a customized version is desired, such as
				longer wires or an added "Security Switch" option, then contact
